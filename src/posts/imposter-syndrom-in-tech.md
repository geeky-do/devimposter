# Introduction

This October marks my 11th anniversary working as a Software Engineer. By my count, which tends to be conservative at best and downright unfair in most cases, I have accomplished the following:

###

1.  Developed at least 15 apps
2.  Deployed at least 15 apps
3.  Lead teams of at least three people
4.  Coordinated at least four large technical projects with the dreaded word "refactoring."
5.  Documented existing codebases and wrote countless proposals.
6.  Learned and practically used at least three tech stacks as in switched disciplines

Six is a good number to stop. To contextualize the list above, below are some personal events occurring in the same time frame.

###

1.  Completed a move from Cairo to Amsterdam
2.  Learn(ed/ing) a new language
3.  Found a partner, and we adopted two cats
4.  Re-learned how to cycle
5.  Fell in and out of love with running
6.  I became a vegetarian, quit smoking twice.

The list of personal items makes me realize just how long that period was that I felt such fundamental changes in myself, down to the very minute detail of what I consume. But, on the other hand, the list of professional achievements makes me feel like a loser. 

  

Why such a stark difference? Well, that's where imposter syndrome rears in its ugly head. 

  >Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

The thing is, being an imposter can worsen the more that list gets more impressive. So here is an example of how I can turn that list upside down: 

  
###
1.  Three tech stacks? Jack of all trades, master of none.
2.  Lead teams? Do you even code, bruh?

  

There is a theory that writing a list of things you have done can help with imposter syndrome, but while you are writing, you have anxiety, and you feel like a fraud. It is relentless. I first came across the term five years ago, I think. Unfortunately, I was burning out then and didn't realize it until two years later. However, it usually helps to have a name for the problem, which is why when I created this space, it felt necessary to call it an imposter.

  

Doubtless, if you have come across the term, then you have come across the "Dunning–Kruger effect," and I can certainly see a correlation there. But I would still say that I feel like an imposter in my bones. I felt it starting in tech, and I think it is still just as strong 11 years later.

If you ask me to plot myself on that chart I would say I am a resident of Mt Stupid only occasionally leaving to slide down to the valley of despair and then run back up to my mountain.

I can tell you that I rationally believe I am good at my job, that I am not falsely humble as I can tell you with precision what I can and can't do. I can also say that I am confident I have made every place I worked with slightly better. I can assure you I am constantly learning and improving. But, I can also state with equal confidence that none of this makes a single iota of difference against the onslaught of my imposter syndrome.

Seriously, I am writing this just to exercise the ability to speak of it but I am afraid this will always be a pain in my life.
