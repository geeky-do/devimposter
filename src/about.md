My name is Dina Youssef and I suffer from imposter syndrome as do many people or so I like to think as I would hate to be alone in this. I have fought the urge to blog for sometime now so I am finally caving in when things are looking up as it’s always easier to start with a spring in your step.

I am a bilingual in her thirties and I have lived in three different continents. Currently I am residing in continental Europe’s second most hipster city known as Amsterdam.

I plan on sharing tech content but there is a very good chance you might see the odd thing here and there. I learn things by doing so I will most likely be sharing something I have actually done rather than muse about topics I know little of. So what do I do? At this moment I am a backend engineer but I used to be a mobile engineer. I am most comfortable with Python and Java however I have used Javascript, Kotlin and Swift in the past for various projects.
