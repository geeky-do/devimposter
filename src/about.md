My name is Dina Youssef, and I suffer from imposter syndrome, as do many people, or so I would like to think as I would hate to be alone in this. I have fought the urge to blog for some time; therefore, I am finally caving in when things are looking up, as it’s always easier to start with a spring in your step.

I am bilingual in my thirties, and I have lived on three different continents. Currently, I am residing in continental Europe’s second most hipster city known as Amsterdam.

I plan on sharing tech content, but there is an excellent chance you might see the odd thing here and there. I learn things by doing so; I will most likely share something I have done. So what do I do? At this moment, I am a backend engineer, but I used to be a mobile engineer. I am most comfortable with Python and Java, but I have previously used Javascript, Kotlin, and Swift.
